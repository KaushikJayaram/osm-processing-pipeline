-- Curvature v2: placeholder step to keep the pipeline modular.
-- At the moment, bucketing and per-vertex contribution meters are computed in
-- 02_compute_vertex_angles.sql.
--
-- This file exists so it’s easy to iterate on bucketing thresholds / weighting
-- without rewriting the geometry + radius calculation step.

-- No-op for now.
